# Serendipity-Bookstore-Project
C++ project: Point-of-sale software package for a bookstore.

Serendipity  Booksellers  is  a  small  bookstore  located  in  a  shopping  mall.  They  have  a  cashier station equipped with a personal computer. The manager wants you to develop a point-of-sale  (POS)  software  package  that  will  make  the  computer  function  as  a  cash  register and keep an inventory file. The inventory file will be a database of all the books in the bookstore. In general, the software is to perform the following tasks: 
  
  • Calculate the total of a sale, including sales tax 
  • When a book is purchased, subtract it from the inventory file 
  • Add, change, delete, and look up books in the inventory file 
  • Display various sales reports
  
  The program will be organized into the following three modules: 
  
    •Cashier module 
    •Inventory Database module 
    •Report module 
  
  When the program runs, a menu will be displayed on the screen, which allows the user to activate any of the modules.
